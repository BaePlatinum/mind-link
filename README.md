Mind Link is a lightweight, front‑end prototype designed to help students structure focused study sessions. The application allows users to select a study duration, start and end sessions, and receive clear visual feedback on their progress. The project emphasizes usability, clarity, and rapid prototyping rather than production‑level backend integration.

This application was built using **React** with **Vite** as the development and build tool, allowing for fast startup times and an efficient development workflow.
